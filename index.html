          <p>
            Our driving school stands apart from larger institutions by putting
            students at the center of everything we do. We understand that
            becoming a confident driver requires more than just technical skills
            - it demands personalized attention and support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than treating you as just another number, we create a
            nurturing environment where we help you overcome driving anxiety and
            build confidence behind the wheel. Our dedicated approach ensures
            every student receives the individualized care needed to succeed,
            transforming fear into competence through patient guidance and
            understanding.

          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <h3>Dick - Instructor and Owner</h3>
          <p>
            Since Richard or Dick, as he prefers to be called by his friends,
            arrived as a refugee with his family in the Netherlands in 2019, he
            has transformed his journey into a remarkable success story. His
            establishment of Green Light driving school represents not just
            personal achievement, but a commitment to helping others navigate
            their own path.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Dick explains, his motivation stems from two powerful drivers:
            "To be able to give something back, but especially because this is a
            great opportunity for newcomers." Through his business, he actively
            seeks to support students from diverse backgrounds, creating a
            positive cycle of opportunity and integration.
